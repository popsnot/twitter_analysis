# twitter_analysis
Relevant code and files for my analysis of Stanford's SNAP Twitter dataset.

I am applying PageRank and cosine similarity to a raw dataset of roughly 2000000 graph edges and profile features of over 80000 twitter users. The aim of this project is to determine whether there is any relationship between a user's influence on Twitter and their profile features (content they post), while getting familiar with parallel programming in PySpark.

All coding and testing will be done using Google Colab and clusters.
