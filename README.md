# twitter_analysis
Relevant code and files for my analysis of Stanford's SNAP Twitter dataset.

I am applying PageRank, TF-IDF and cosine similarity to a raw dataset of roughly 2,000,000 graph edges and profile features of over 80,000 twitter users. The aim of this project is to determine whether there is any relationship between a user's influence on Twitter and their profile features (content they post). Then, we can determine the significance of their profile features within top users, potentially giving insight into which profile features are most associated with influence within Twitter.

All coding and testing will be done using PySpark on Google Colab and Google Cloud clusters.
